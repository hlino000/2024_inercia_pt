The all important website for Inércia 2024 demoparty!

Hacked together from NOVA 2024 demoparty reference website (with permission). Because doing websites is fucking boring. Please volunteer to do Inércia 2025 website if you disagree!

Directly updates on https://2024.inercia.pt

# TODO

- update css to match the colors of this years image
- text on participate for each section more clear (not a wall of text paragraph)
- add paragraph about associação inércia on contact
- add press kit info and download link on contact
- add team information on contact page
- credit nova website somewhere
- add some screenshots for music showcase
- add register page
- add a news page to list the most important changes
- add supporters logos section on footer (so far this year: SFIA, camara de almada, enough records)
- optimize size of some of the heavier images
- retest all pages under all resolutions
