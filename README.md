The all important website for Inércia 2024 demoparty!

Hacked together from NOVA 2024 demoparty reference website (with permission). Because doing websites is fucking boring. Please volunteer to do Inércia 2025 website if you disagree!

Should be a preview on https://psenough.github.io/2024_inercia_pt/

And eventually make it's way to https://2024.inercia.pt

# TODO

- replace splash image on index.html
- replace background (is taken from NOVA)
- update css to match the colors of this years image
- add press kit info and download link on contact
- add schedule page
- add team information on contact page
- credit nova website somewhere
- better thumbnail for inércia 2023 video
- add mastodon and bluesky icons on footer
- add some screenshots for music showcase
- add register page
- add supporters logos section on footer (so far this year: SFIA, camara de almada, enough records)
- optimize size of some of the heavier images
- retest all pages under all resolutions
- change the 2024.inercia.pt DNS to point to github pages, then create a CNAME file with `2024.inercia.pt` (if you do it before the DNS is changed, the preview stops working properly)
